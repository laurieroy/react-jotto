# Jotto clone - WIP
This was built to practice using TDD in React with jest, as a part of [Bonnie Schulkin](https://bonnie.dev/courses)'s [React Testing with Jest and Enzyme](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/?referralCode=3A42BF689E28CADB0587). 

I'm using prop types here just to have practice having tested them, though I realize using TS will be the more common use case. 

## The game:
Jotto is 2-player game where each player selects a 5-letter dictionary word. The opposite player attempts to guess the word. Any letters of the guessed word that match in the secret word are noted down. Here, the user is playing against the computer.

<!-- Play on the [demo]() app -->
